## Overview

This repository contains demo code and community projects developed using the phospho starter pack. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, you can explore existing projects or contribute your own creations.

## Getting started

1. **Get Your Dev Kit**: Purchase your Phospho starter pack at [robots.phospho.ai](https://robots.phospho.ai). Unbox it and set it up following the instructions in the box.

2. **Install the phosphobot server** and run it:

```bash
# Install it this way
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phospho-app/phosphobot/main/install.sh | bash
# Start it this way
phosphobot run
# Upgrade it with brew or with apt
# sudo apt update && sudo apt install phosphobot
# brew update && brew upgrade phosphobot
```

3. Use the HTTP API to interact with the phosphobot server.

Go to the interactive docs of the API to use it interactively and learn more about it.
It is available at `YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS:YOUR_SERVER_PORT/docs`. By default, it is available at `localhost:80/docs`.

We release new versions very often, so make sure to check the API docs for the latest features and changes.

## How to train ACT with LeRobot?

1. **Record a Dataset with phosphobot**: Record a dataset using the app. Do the same gesture 30-50 times (depending on the task complexity) to create a dataset. [Learn more](https://docs.phospho.ai/basic-usage/dataset-recording)

2. **Install LeRobot**. [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) by HuggingFace is a research-oriented library for AI training which is still a work in progress. We made a few workarounds to make sure it works reliably. On MacOS, here is a step by step guide.

2.1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a Python environment manager.

```bash
# On macOS and Linux.
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2.2 Create a new directory and install requirements.

```bash
mkdir my_model
cd my_model
uv init
uv add phosphobot git+https://github.com/phospho-app/lerobot
git clone https://github.com/phospho-app/lerobot
```

2.3 On MacOS M1, you need to set this variable for torchcodec to work.

```bash
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/homebrew/lib:/usr/local/lib:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

2.4 Run the **LeRobot** training script. For example, on Mac M1:

```bash
uv run lerobot/lerobot/scripts/train.py \
 --dataset.repo_id=PLB/simple-lego-pickup-mono-2 \
 --policy.type=act \
 --output_dir=outputs/train/phoshobot_test \
 --job_name=phosphobot_test \
 --policy.device=mps
```

Change the dataset.repo_id to the id of your dataset on Hugging Face.

Change the `--policy.device` flag based on your hardware: `cuda` if you have an NVIDIA GPU, `mps` if you use a MacBook Pro Sillicon, and `cpu` otherwise.

3. **Use the ACT model to control your robot**:

3.1 Launch the ACT server to run inference. This should be running on a beefy GPU machine. Check out our folder [/inference] for more details.

```bash
curl -o server.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phospho-app/phosphobot/refs/heads/main/inference/ACT/server.py
```

```bash
uv run server.py --model_id LegrandFrederic/Orange-brick-in-black-box # Replace with <YOUR_HF_MODEL_ID>
```

3.2 Make sure the [phosphobot server](https://docs.phospho.ai/installation) is running to control your robot:

```bash
# Install it this way
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phospho-app/phosphobot/main/install.sh | bash
# Start it this way
phosphobot run
```

3.3 Create a script called `my_model/client.py` and copy paste the content below.

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#     "phosphobot",
# ]
# ///
from phosphobot.camera import AllCameras
import httpx
from phosphobot.am import ACT

import time
import numpy as np

# Connect to the phosphobot server
PHOSPHOBOT_API_URL = "http://localhost:80"

# Get a camera frame
allcameras = AllCameras()

# Need to wait for the cameras to initialize
time.sleep(1)

# Instantiate the model
model = ACT()

while True:
    images = [
        allcameras.get_rgb_frame(camera_id=0, resize=(240, 320)),
        allcameras.get_rgb_frame(camera_id=1, resize=(240, 320)),
        allcameras.get_rgb_frame(camera_id=2, resize=(240, 320)),
    ]

    # Get the robot state
    state = httpx.post(f"{PHOSPHOBOT_API_URL}/joints/read").json()

    inputs = {"state": np.array(state.angles_rad), "images": np.array(images)}

    # Go through the model
    actions = model(inputs)

    for action in actions:
        # Send the new joint postion to the robot
        httpx.post(f"{PHOSPHOBOT_API_URL}/joints/write", json={"angles": action.tolist()})
        # Wait to respect frequency control (30 Hz)
        time.sleep(1 / 30)
```

3.4 Run this script to control your robot using the model:

```
uv run client.py
```

For the full detailed instructions and other model (Pi0, OpenVLA,...), refer to the [docs](https://docs.phospho.ai/basic-usage/inference).
